# 👋 Hi, I’m Luis Fernando

I'm a software engineer with more than five years of experience, passionate about those things that generate impact. I love politics, economics and entrepreneurship. I currently work at [Bridge for Billions](https://www.bridgeforbillions.org) helping to build an app that powers entrepreneurship ecosystems in over 90 countries.

My focus is Frontend; although I have theoretical and practical experience in product design, my strenght is the development of these products. My main tools are React and its derivatives (including React Native and Next.js). And lately, I've been learning more about Solidity, the Blockchain ecosystem, and how to use decentralized networks as the Backend for new applications.

*P.S. I love the idea of using Blockchain technology with government institutions and economic systems.*

## ⚒️   My projects:

You can see a little bit of those projects that I feature here in my GitHub and portfolio. They give a good idea about how I like to work and what kind of stuff I can do. (They are not the only ones, it's just that I like them)

- **[ToneDesk](https://github.com/LuFernandoMG/ToneDesk)**: *(React, Redux, Firebase)* I love music; this was a little personal challenge to test my knowledge of React and Redux by using Firebase to create an application that allows me to register my favorite artists, albums, songs, and other music content.
- **[NativeDex](https://github.com/LuFernandoMG/Nativedex)**: *(React Native, Expo, Android Studio, Xcode)* Like many people out there, as a kid, I was a big Pokemon fan; I dreamed of being able to have some of these monsters with me and be a trainer. And what does any trainer need? Of course, a PokeDex. Although I'm sure, our cell phone will suffice for now.
- **[Cosmovision](Cosmovision-Blockchain/cosmovision-eth)**: *(Next.js, Solidity, React)* As a Latin American, I understand the magnitude of our roots, but these are cultures that are slowly being lost in history. What if we save them in a decentralized database? This project was generated as a team during Platzi's Ethereum Developer Program. In my case, I was in charge of doing the initial setup in Next.JS, contributing with the Frontend, reviewing some Solidity contracts and connecting the Frontend interface with the functions deployed in Solidity. 
- **[Tetris](https://github.com/LuFernandoMG/Tetris)**: *(React)* When I was a teenager, I loved video games, and I always dreamed of being able to create one someday. This was one of my first projects while I was learning React, but it helped me to fulfill that goal of making my own video game someday.
- **[Petgram](https://github.com/LuFernandoMG/Petgram)**: *(React, Style Components)* In Petgram we are based on one of the most famous applications in the world, but more than a faithful clone that seeks to replicate all the sections, we wanted to put into practice some of the advanced concepts of React, such as Context usage, Custom Hooks creation, React.Lazy, performance improvements and testing.
- **[ReactMovie](https://github.com/LuFernandoMG/ReactMovie)**: *(React)* In MovieApp, we started showing a bit of conventional React usage in any application deployed in production. This exercise aims to show the consumption of APIs from React, the handling of Hooks, and a review of all the tools React gives us for general use.
